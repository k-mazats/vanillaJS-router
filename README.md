# vanillaJS-router

Router and Components classes for smalls SPA, works with github-pages

Local branch is for local development server

Main branch is for hosting on github pages 

*For this to work you need to replace "/vanillaJS-router" by "/name-of-your-project" in every js file. 
You'll also need to redirect 404 errors to your 404.html using [this doc](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-custom-404-page-for-your-github-pages-site)*
